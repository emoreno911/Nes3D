# Nes3D
An interactive visualization for nested NFTs on the UNIQUE Network

## Description
Since the birth of the disruptive concept of NFT’s it was known that we were only at the entrance of a new world, a new step in the world of cryptocurrencies applicable to many aspects of everyday life. Now we talk about nested NFT’s, where the owner of an NFT does not have to be an externally owned account or a smart contract, it can also be a specific NFT. Some examples of use could be found in the gaming industry where we could have a main account that represents the father NFT and from it we get game related features such as: Avatar, backpack, weapons, etc.

There is a lack of platforms to visualize this technology and that's why we thought of one where not only to visualize but to interact with those NFTs. So we describe **Nes3D** as a tool that allows users to visualize and interact with nested NFT’s in a comprehensive and easy way.
